# Unit 5 Lab: Tic-Tac-Toe


## Directions
For this cumulative lab, you will simply build a Tic-Tac-Toe game.

**Here are your requirements:**
1. You must use object-orientation to encapsulate your game logic and UI updates.
2. Your Tic-Tac-Toe game should be designed as a two-player game. In other words, you are not responsible for creating a CPU or an AI to play against user. Your game should simply alternate between 'X's and 'O's upon clicks, allowing two players to sit next to each other and play on one computer.
3. Your game should clearly identify a winner or indicate when a "draw" has occurred.
4. Your game should have the ability to "restart" without refreshing the page by clearing the board.

## Scoring
Your submission will be scored against the following criteria:
1. **Game Play:**
  * Is your game intuitive to play?
  * Does your game produce a winner and/or draw state in line with the rules of tic-tac-toe?
2. **User Interface/Experience:**
  * Is your game board visually appealing?
  * Does your game respond predictably to user input?
3. **Code Quality:**
  * Is your game logic encapsulated into classes?
  * Are your UI methods encapsulated as well?

## Brownie Points 🧁
Once you have satisfied the requirements above, consider implementing the following feature requests as an added challenge! 💪🏽
  * Add a scoreboard
  * Implement a single-player mode by adding a Computer player. Your computer player can be "dumb" and just place 'O's in a random available space.
  * Build an AI that competes intelligently. 😳
